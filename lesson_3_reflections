Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When working on a team project with several other developers, so that all team members have access to my latest code changes.
   Also, in case of using different machines, eg : I can work from the office and from my laptop at home, but I want all my changes
   to be updated in one central location.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: When working on a big project or feature that may require 1000s of lines of code,
   we want to make sure there is a working logical piece of code change/functionality that
   is ready to be checked into the remote repository. Keeping local repository in sync with remote
   might also bring in changes from other users , possibly functions being changed by a different developer, 
   that might cause compilation to fail for me. Whereas with manual pull, I can make sure that I
   have a working piece of code, then update from remote and then compile in the end & resolve any errors if required.
